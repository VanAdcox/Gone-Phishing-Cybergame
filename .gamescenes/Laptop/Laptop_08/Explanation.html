        <h1 class="glitch">!! URGENT SYSTEM ALERT: RANSOMWARE DETECTED - YOUR FILES ARE ENCRYPTED !!</h1>
        <p><strong class="important">What happened:</strong> Your system has been infected with ransomware, a type of malicious software that encrypts your files, making them inaccessible. This infection was triggered by clicking a malicious link in an email.</p>

    <p><strong class="important">What this means:</strong> All files on your device, including documents, photos, videos, and databases, are now encrypted. You will not be able to open or access these files without a decryption key.</p>

    <p><strong class="important">Why this is happening:</strong> Ransomware is used by cybercriminals to extort money. They demand a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key.</p>

    <p><strong class="important">What you should do NOW:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong class="important">DO NOT POWER OFF OR RESTART YOUR COMPUTER.</strong> This could worsen the situation.</li>
        <li><strong class="important">IMMEDIATELY DISCONNECT</strong> from the network (Wi-Fi or Ethernet). This will help prevent the ransomware from spreading to other devices.</li>
        <li><strong class="important">DO NOT</strong> attempt to modify or repair the encrypted files. This could result in permanent data loss.</li>
        <li>Locate the file "DECRYPT_INSTRUCTIONS.txt" on your desktop. This file contains instructions from the attackers.</li>
        <li><strong class="important">CONTACT YOUR IT DEPARTMENT IMMEDIATELY.</strong> They will assess the situation and determine the best course of action.</li>
    </ol>

<h3>Understanding Ransomware:</h3>
    <p>Ransomware is a serious threat. It often spreads through phishing emails, malicious websites, and infected software downloads. Prevention is key.</p>

    <h3>How to protect yourself in the future:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Be vigilant about emails:</strong> Never click on links or open attachments from unknown or suspicious senders.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep software updated:</strong> Regularly update your operating system, antivirus software, and other applications to patch security vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Back up your data:</strong> Regularly back up your important files to an external drive or cloud storage. This will allow you to restore your data in case of a ransomware attack.</li>
        <li><strong>Use strong passwords:</strong> Use complex and unique passwords for all your accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>Be cautious about downloads:</strong> Only download software from trusted sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement security awareness training:</strong> educate yourself and others about phishing and other cybersecurity threats.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong class="important">Remember:</strong> Paying the ransom is not guaranteed to restore your files and may encourage further criminal activity.</p>
