        <h1>Office Memo</h1>
        <p>Great job, the man on the phone was trying to use Social Engineering against you. Social Engineering is the manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

People like the one who called you ask these kids of questions over the phone to gain information about you or the place you work in hopes that they can exploit that information.

It's best practice to not answer personal or security related questions to someone you don't trust.</p>
